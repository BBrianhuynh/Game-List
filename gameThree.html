    <p>Valorant is a tactical shooting game involving two teams with 5 players in each team. Every player can sign in
      and play remotely from anywhere in the world. Every game has 25 rounds and the team that wins 13 of them first
      wins the game. Players can choose their in-game characters called agents at the start of the game.</p>
